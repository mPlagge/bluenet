/**
 * A CuckooFilter is a probabilistic datatype is made for approximate membership queries.
 *
 * This implementation consists of the POD data structure `cuckoo_filter_data_t` and a
 * 'view class' `Cuckoofilter`, which is used to manipulate the data struct.
 *
 * The cuckoo_filter_data_t struct is not aware of its size. That must be managed by the owning
 * scope, which can query the required size in bytes for the given amount of fingerprints through
 * the CuckooFilter class.
 *
 * The 'elements' that one can `add` to a `CuckooFilter` are of type `cuckoo_key_t` which are
 * simply sequences of bytes. To check if an element is contained in a filter, refer to the
 * `contains` methods.
 *
 * CuckooFilter data contents are stored in an array of fingerprints which is segmented into
 * 'buckets'. These buckets are used for indexing, and although for an element, the bucket index and
 * fingerprint are deterministic, the index inside the bucket is dependent on order of insertion.
 *
 * More details can be found in `https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-conext2014.pdf`.
